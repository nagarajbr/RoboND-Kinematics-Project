** KINEMATIC ANALYSIS **



I diagrammed the Kuka arm as follows:

Using this, I obtained the following *DH* table:

***i** | **α** | **a** | **d** | **Θ**
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
1 | 0 | 0 | 0.750 | Θ1
2 | -90 | 0.350 | 0 | Θ2 - 90
3 | 0 | 1.250 | 0 | Θ3
4 | -90 | 0.054 | 1.500 | Θ4
5 | 90 | 0 | 0 | Θ5
6 | -90 | 0 | 0 | Θ6
G | 0 | 0 | 0.303 | 0
